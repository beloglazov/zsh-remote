This is my configuration of Arch Linux + Xmonad + Zsh. The repository includes the following
configuration files:

 * Xmonad config
 * Zsh configs
 * oh-my-zsh with a custom theme
 * Emacs configs
 * .xinitrc
 * .Xresources
 * .gitconfig
 * .nanorc
 * .rtorrent.rc
 * and others

Apart from that, simple installation scripts are also included.

# Installation

First of all, you need to clone this repository to any directory you want:

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/beloglazov/arch-xmonad-zsh.git
```

Next, you need to cd into the cloned repository:

```Bash
cd arch-xmonad-zsh
```

The repository contains a number of installation scripts. They can be used to configure a clean
installation of Arch Linux. To apply the configuration, you need to run the scripts one by one
according to their numbers. The first script must be run as root to setup the sudo command. The
other scripts can be run by a regular user, which is sudo-enabled. Once all the installation scripts
have been run, it's best to reboot the system to see the changes. To run Xmonad, just login as a
regular user and run:

```Bash
startx
```

Enjoy!
